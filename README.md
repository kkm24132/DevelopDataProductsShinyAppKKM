The shiny application developed is a Body Mass Index Calculator.
It is very simple to use, just insert your "Weight" and your "Height" and click submit and you'll get your BMI and the diagnostic.
The files of the applications are:

There is a default "Height" and "Weight" value which exists while the application is run.
